        SecureAuth API
    </h1>
    <p align="center">
        SecureAuth API is a simple, introductory RESTful service designed to explore the fundamentals of token-based security with Spring Boot. Leveraging Spring Security and JWT, this project demonstrates basic user registration, authentication, and protected resource access, offering a hands-on learning experience for implementing secure Java backend applications.

## üìù Features

All API routes for the listed features have been fully developed and are functional. As this project is purely educational, there is no front-end implementation. Below is a detailed list of the features and their status:

- [x] User registration
- [x] User login
- [x] Client-only route access
- [x] Administrator-only route access
- [x] Token validation

<div id="application-demonstration"></div>

## üì≤ Application Demonstration

Since this is a backend API, you can test it locally using Insomnia or other API testing services like Postman. Below are the images showcasing the typical workflow:

- Create a user

- Log in and obtain a JWT token

- Test general endpoints (token validation)

- Test client-only routes

- Test admin-only routes with a client token (results in failure due to lack of admin permission)

## üìÅ Setup and Run the Application

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Java 21+](https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/downloads/).

It‚Äôs also recommended to use an IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the Java Extension Pack) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

### üöÄ How to Run the Application

#### Back-End Setup

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ArturColen/secure-rest-api-spring-boot-jwt.git

# Navigate to the project folder
$ cd secure-rest-api-spring-boot-jwt

# Run the application
# Option 1: If using an IDE, open the project and run the main class (annotated with @SpringBootApplication)
# Option 2: If using the terminal, run the following command:
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The server will start on port 8080 by default ‚Äî you can now test the API using tools like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
